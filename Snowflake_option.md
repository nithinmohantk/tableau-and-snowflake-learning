SNOWFLAKE https://www.snowflake.com/ 

The largest software IPO EVER happened last year, so this is one worth knowing about. Also a great talking point for interviews, as you can get into the whole cloud vs on premise data infrastructure debate - snowflake aren’t the only show in town but they are the one being talked about the most. The core idea is that a company buys credits and manages their warehouse in the cloud, assigning different sized remote warehouses instantly to different sorts of queries and tasks. This is potentially a game changer for a company with performance issues on their internal or external data analytics efforts especially if thy work with big/unstructured data.

Hands on demo with free trial option - I attended this one last week and I have to say it was one of the better hands on demo sessions I have attended. it takes about 90 mins. The instructor takes you step by step through using the UI, including running and re running queries, setting up the user profiles, troubleshooting - working with  json files in the cloud was very impressive and there are some very unusual clone and roll back features (the ‘oops I made a boobie, now what do I do’ section is always helpful for interview prep).
