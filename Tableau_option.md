TABLEAU 

Tableau Conference 2020 

The conference was 100% virtual this year and ran at the end of last week. 
To learn more about what you can do with Tableau, and where it is going in the near future, this is a great time to take a look at some of the conference content, try some features out yourself and think about how you might use Tableau for the remainder of your free education license.  As the event only just finished there are a few videos on YouTube to stream, more will be added in the coming weeks. You can also sign in to your tableau account to attend the conference and stream the content directly from the website, as I have done here https://tc20.tableau.com/ 

My recommendations on the TC20 website :

Devs at Desks : https://tc20.tableau.com/episodes/devs-desks-data-skills-data-people-393  Normally called Devs on Stage, this is a regular conference highlight where new and prototype features are presented. This year they are working from their desks instead … but still great demos of what’s coming down the road . 

#datafamcommunityjam https://tc20.tableau.com/episodes/datafamcommunityjam-ep-5-716 - some useful instructional style demos including my former colleague and bff Katie Wagner, on current features 

Anatomy of a dashboard - focused on individual sectors - very useful if you already know what sector you want to work in, as the business users talk about what particular features of a dashboard they like and used.  I liked the retail one https://tc20.tableau.com/episodes/anatomy-dashboard-retail-and-enterprise-347 

Wade Davis - this is a chat rather than a demo, but timely talk on the Diversity in tech perspective, in this era of black lives matter protests this is obviously critical to an American audience but also I felt raised some tough subjects and useful talking points for future interviews  https://tc20.tableau.com/episodes/data-diversity-fireside-chat-wade-davis-part-2-444

Salesforce + Tableau https://tc20.tableau.com/episodes/einstein-analytics-intelligence-your-salesforce-crm-554 if you are going into an industry where salesforce is used a lot to manage sales (hint, its pretty much everywhere!) I would check this one out too 

You tube videos if you don’t want to log in 

1. Opening key note includes demos of current features from 41 min 23 onwards https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHrSfCH8ejI 
2. Devs at Desks - video with commentary which is kinda cool or annoying depending on your frame of mind. The demo content starts from 17 min 21 sec  so fast forward to there.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_f4AoVWJ7o
3. If you didn’t know Tableau paired up with Salesforce - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KQ8KGJtLn8 
4. If you want a good laugh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LnWX91Y0Q8 … I just can’t even describe this or why it exists.
