# tableau-and-snowflake-learning



IF you are in the mood for some hands on tableau practice today then I can wholeheartedly recommend trying this https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/


Pick a week with some data that interests you, or simply go for this weekâ€™s challenge, download the data from data.world, give yourself no more than 90 mins to try washboarding it. You can also look at the blog/video of past weeks efforts (eg https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/week-36-2020/ fast forward to 5 minutes in) and try to recreate something you see. The basic idea is, a dataset and published visual of that data is released every week, you have a go at redoing it, submission of global entries happens by the Sunday, and then the organisers pick their favourite efforts. Everything is done via tableau public and twitter so there is no paywall between you and this superb community learning resource.
